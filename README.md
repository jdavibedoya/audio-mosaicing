# audio-mosaicing
 
The main goal of this project is to create an audio mosaic using the Freesound API to search and download audios, and Essentia to analyze them. The process is divided into three notebooks available at https://github.com/ffont/amplab-freesound. 
Here the notebooks are modified to make the sound reconstruction synchronous to the the beat of the target signal, and using a set of percussion instrument samples of the Beijing Opera.
